                <p class="p-firsdisplay">
                    <strong style="color: black;">Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> is a numerical value derived from an individual's
                    weight and height, serving as a common measure to classify underweight, normal weight, overweight,
                    and obesity in adults. The formula to calculate BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/mÂ²).
                    While BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly assess body fat percentage or distribution, and it may not be accurate for all individuals, especially
                    those with high muscle mass. It's important to consider other factors, such as age, gender, and overall health, when interpreting BMI results.
                    Consulting a healthcare professional for a comprehensive health assessment is always recommended.

                            When using a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, <strong style="color: blue; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">it's important to remember that the result is just a rough estimate of your overall health based on height and weight.</strong>
                            Always consult a doctor after obtaining your BMI results, as they can provide more personalized insights and guidance.
                            For pregnant and breastfeeding women, BMI calculations are not always accurate due to changes in body composition.
                            It's best for these individuals to seek advice from a healthcare professional for tailored health assessments and recommendations.

                        <p>Warning: The Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using the formula:</p>
                        <p>BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)<sup>2</sup></p>
                        <p>This formula only considers height and weight, and does not account for factors such as muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition. As a result, BMI may not accurately reflect an individual's health status. Always consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive assessment.</p>
