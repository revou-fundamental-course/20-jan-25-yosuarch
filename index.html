                        <p>
                            <strong style="color: black;">Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong> is a numerical value derived from an individual's
                            weight and height, serving as a common measure to classify underweight, normal weight, overweight,
                            and obesity in adults. The formula to calculate BMI is weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/mÂ²).
                            While BMI is a useful screening tool, it doesn't directly assess body fat percentage or distribution, and it may not be accurate for all individuals, especially
                            those with high muscle mass. It's important to consider other factors, such as age, gender, and overall health, when interpreting BMI results.
                            Consulting a healthcare professional for a comprehensive health assessment is always recommended.
